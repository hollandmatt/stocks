# Stocks

This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and follows the conventions it sets out for file naming etc.

## Running

To run the app, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

You can then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

Alternatively, you can view the app live, via [https://hollandmatt.github.io/stocks/](https://hollandmatt.github.io/stocks/
) - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is used to keep this up to date.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, enter:

```
npm test
```

Tests are written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and the React component tests use [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used to keep the code in a consistent format, to run it use:

```
npm run prettier
```
